# Bookstore App
A GUI-based Bookstore application using OOP concepts in Java. A state pattern was implemented and the GUI of the application was developed using JavaFX. 

## Description
The program consists of two types of users–Owner and Customers. The app uses a single-window GUI, and stores Customer Information and Book details in a tabular format. The ‘Owner’ user can add, delete, modify customer information and book details. Every customer receives ‘reward points’ and is assigned a ‘status’ based on the collected points. The program is designed to perform transactions for every book purchased by the customer, with an added feature to redeem the points. With each book purchased, the customer’s points and status are updated. 
To access the app as an 'Owner' the username and password are 'admin'.
